## Core concepts

### `page`
Represents the browser tab Playwright controls. Every action you take in the browser goes through `page`. Think of it as a remote control for one tab.

```javascript
await page.goto('https://example.com');   // navigate to a URL
await page.getByLabel('Username').fill('tomsmith');  // type into a field
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' }).click();  // click a button
```

---

### `async` and `await`

`async` on a function means "this function contains things that take time".
`await` on a line means "wait for this to finish before moving to the next line".

Without `await`, Playwright would try to click a button before the page had even loaded.

```javascript
// correct - waits for the page to load before clicking
await page.goto('https://example.com');
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Submit' }).click();
```

---

### `test()`
Defines one test. Takes two things: a name (what the test does) and a function (what it actually runs).

```javascript
test('user can log in', async ({ page }) => {
  // test steps go here
});
```

The name shows up in your test report — make it descriptive so failures are easy to identify.

---

### `expect()`
The assertion — the part that actually checks something is true. If the check fails, the test fails.

```javascript
await expect(page).toHaveURL('https://example.com/dashboard');
await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/My App/);
await expect(page.getByText('Welcome')).toBeVisible();
```

Without assertions, your test just clicks around without verifying anything worked.

---

### `const`
A way of saving something to a name so you can reuse it without writing it out again.

```javascript
const checkbox1 = page.getByRole('checkbox').first();
await checkbox1.check();
await expect(checkbox1).toBeChecked();
```

The value saved with `const` cannot be reassigned — it stays as what you set it to.

---

### `for` loops

A way of repeating the same code once for every item in a list (array). Instead of writing the same thing multiple times, you write it once and let the loop handle the repetition.

```javascript
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

for (const fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}
// prints: apple, then banana, then orange
```

**Reading it in plain English:** `for (const fruit of fruits)` means "go through each item in `fruits` one at a time, calling the current item `fruit`".

**In Playwright tests**, loops are used to run the same test multiple times with different data:

```javascript
for (const data of invalidCredentials) {
  test(`failed login with ${data.username}`, async ({ page }) => {
    await loginPage.login(data.username, data.password);
    await expect(page.getByText(data.error)).toBeVisible();
  });
}
```

The loop runs once per item in the array — two items means two tests, ten items means ten tests.

**Key rule:** The name you choose inside the loop (e.g. `fruit`, `data`, `checkbox`) represents whichever single item the loop is currently on. Pick a name that makes sense for what each item represents.

---

## Finding elements (locators)

These are the ways you find things on a page to interact with or check.

### `getByRole()`
The preferred way to find elements in Playwright. Finds an element by its **role** (what type of element it is) and optionally its **name** (what it says).

```javascript
page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' })   // a button that says Login
page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Logout' })    // a link that says Logout
page.getByRole('checkbox')                     // a checkbox
page.getByRole('textbox')                      // a text input
```

**Important habit:** Before writing any `getByRole`, inspect the element in your browser first. Identify the HTML (HyperText Markup Language) tag, then match it to the correct role below.

#### Roles table

| Role | What it matches | HTML tag |
|------|----------------|----------|
| `'button'` | A clickable button | `<button>` |
| `'link'` | A clickable link | `<a>` |
| `'checkbox'` | A tick box | `<input type="checkbox">` |
| `'textbox'` | A text input field | `<input type="text">` |
| `'heading'` | A heading | `<h1>`, `<h2>` etc |

---

### `getByLabel()`
Finds an input field by the label text next to it. Great for forms.

```javascript
page.getByLabel('Username')
page.getByLabel('Password')
```

---

### `getByText()`
Finds any element that contains specific text. Useful for checking messages appear.

```javascript
page.getByText('Your username is invalid!')
```

---

### `getByPlaceholder()`
Finds an input by its placeholder text (the grey hint text inside an empty field).

```javascript
page.getByPlaceholder('Enter your email')
```

---

## Picking one element from many

When a locator matches more than one element on the page, Playwright needs help knowing which one you mean.

### `.first()`
Picks the first matching element.

```javascript
page.getByRole('checkbox').first()
```

### `.last()`
Picks the last matching element.

```javascript
page.getByRole('checkbox').last()
```

### `.all()`
Returns every matching element as an array (a list). Used when you want to loop through all matching elements. Needs `await`.

```javascript
const checkboxes = await page.getByRole('checkbox').all();
```

---

## Actions

Things you do to elements once you've found them. Always need `()` at the end.

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `.click()` | Clicks the element |
| `.fill('text')` | Types into an input field (clears it first) |
| `.press('Enter')` | Presses a keyboard key |
| `.check()` | Checks a checkbox |
| `.uncheck()` | Unchecks a checkbox |
| `.selectOption('value')` | Selects from a dropdown |

---

## Assertions

Things you check with `expect()`. Always need `()` at the end.

| Assertion | What it checks |
|-----------|---------------|
| `toHaveURL('...')` | The page URL (Uniform Resource Locator) matches |
| `toHaveTitle(/.../)` | The page title matches |
| `toBeVisible()` | The element is visible on screen |
| `toBeChecked()` | A checkbox is checked |
| `toContainText('...')` | An element contains this text |
| `toHaveValue('...')` | An input field has this value |
| `toBe(value)` | A value equals exactly what you specify — used for numbers and strings, not page elements |

---

## Test file structure

```javascript
// 1. always at the top
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

// 2. one test() block per test
test('descriptive name of what this test checks', async ({ page }) => {

  // 3. navigate to the page
  await page.goto('https://example.com');

  // 4. interact with the page
  await page.getByLabel('Username').fill('tomsmith');

  // 5. assert something is true
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('https://example.com/dashboard');

});
```

---

## Organising tests

### `test.describe()`
Groups related tests together under a label. Makes test reports easier to read.

```javascript
test.describe('Login page', () => {

  test('successful login', async ({ page }) => { ... });
  test('failed login', async ({ page }) => { ... });

}); // end describe('Login page')
```

---

### `test.beforeEach()`
Runs automatically before every test in the file or describe block. Use it for setup every test needs.

```javascript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com/login');
});
```

---

### `test.only()` and `test.skip()`

`test.only()` — runs only that one test, skips everything else. Useful when debugging.
**Never push `test.only` to GitHub** — it causes all other tests to be skipped in CI (Continuous Integration).

`test.skip()` — skips that test and runs everything else. Useful when a test is failing due to a known bug.

---

## How to organise test files

- One spec (specification — a test file) per page or feature
- Name files clearly: `login.spec.js`, `checkboxes.spec.js`
- Never nest one `test()` block inside another
- One test should verify one thing — independent assertions belong in separate tests

---

## Data-driven testing

Running the same test multiple times with different data, using an **array** (a list) and a **`for` loop**.

**Step 1 — define your data array:**
Each item in the array is one test run. Each item can have multiple fields.

```javascript
const invalidCredentials = [
  { username: 'wronguser', password: 'SuperSecretPassword!', error: 'Your username is invalid!' },
  { username: 'tomsmith',  password: 'wrongpassword',        error: 'Your password is invalid!' },
];
```

**Step 2 — write the `for` loop:**
`for (const data of invalidCredentials)` means "go through each item in the array one at a time, calling it `data`".

```javascript
for (const data of invalidCredentials) {
  test(`failed login with ${data.username}`, async ({ page }) => {
    await loginPage.login(data.username, data.password);
    await expect(page.getByText(data.error)).toBeVisible();
  });
}
```

The loop runs once per item — two items means two tests, five items means five tests.

**Accessing fields:** Use `data.fieldname` — e.g. `data.username`, `data.error`.

**When to use it:** When you need to run the same test logic with different inputs. Avoids writing identical test blocks over and over.

---

## Page Object Model (POM)

A way of organising code so that all locators and actions for a page live in one separate file. Tests then use that file instead of writing locators directly.

**When to use it:** When the same locators or actions appear across multiple tests. See YAGNI.

**File: `pages/LoginPage.js`**
```javascript
export class LoginPage {

  constructor(page) {
    this.page = page;
    this.usernameField = page.getByLabel('Username');
    this.passwordField = page.getByLabel('Password');
    this.loginButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' });
  }

  async login(username, password) {
    await this.usernameField.fill(username);
    await this.passwordField.fill(password);
    await this.loginButton.click();
  }
}
```

**Key terms:**
- `class` — a blueprint. Defines what a page object is and what it can do.
- `constructor` — runs automatically when you write `new LoginPage(page)`. Sets up all the locators.
- `this` — refers to the current instance of the class. `this.usernameField` means "save this on the current LoginPage".
- `export` — makes the class available to other files.
- `import` — brings it in to your test file.

**Using it in a test:**
```javascript
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/LoginPage.js';

const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
await loginPage.login('tomsmith', 'SuperSecretPassword!');
```

---

## Fixtures

Reusable setup code that any test can use by asking for it by name — just like `page`. Unlike `beforeEach`, fixtures only run for tests that specifically request them.

**File: `fixtures/base.js`**
```javascript
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import { LoginPage } from '../pages/LoginPage.js';

export const test = base.extend({
  loggedInPage: async ({ page }, use) => {
    await page.goto('https://example.com/login');
    const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
    await loginPage.login('tomsmith', 'SuperSecretPassword!');
    await use(page); // everything before use() is setup — hands the page to the test
  },
});

export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
```

**Using a fixture in a test:**
```javascript
import { test, expect } from '../fixtures/base.js';

test('logged in user can logout', async ({ loggedInPage }) => {
  await loggedInPage.getByRole('link', { name: 'Logout' }).click();
});
```

**Key difference from `beforeEach`:** A fixture only runs for tests that ask for it by name. `beforeEach` runs for every test in the file regardless.

---

## API testing

Testing an API (Application Programming Interface) directly without a browser. Faster than UI (User Interface) testing — goes straight to the data.

Uses `request` instead of `page`:

```javascript
test('GET post returns 200 status', async ({ request }) => {
  // send a GET request to the endpoint
  const response = await request.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1');

  // check the status code
  await expect(response.status()).toBe(200);

  // parse the response body — converts raw text into a JavaScript object you can read
  const body = await response.json();

  // assert specific field values using dot notation
  await expect(body.userId).toBe(1);
  await expect(body.title).toBe('sunt aut facere...');
});
```

**HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) request types:**

| Request | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `GET` | Retrieves data |
| `POST` | Sends new data |
| `PUT` | Updates existing data |
| `DELETE` | Removes data |

**Common status codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `200` | OK — request succeeded |
| `404` | Not Found — endpoint doesn't exist |
| `500` | Server Error — something broke on the server |

**Notes:**
- Never use `--headed` for API tests — there's no browser to open
- `response.json()` parses the raw response into a JavaScript object so you can access individual fields with `body.fieldname`

---

## Tags and smoke tests

Tags let you label tests so you can run specific groups with one command.

```javascript
test('successful login @smoke', async ({ page }) => { ... });
```

```
npx playwright test --grep "@smoke"
```

A **smoke test** is a quick check of the most critical features — named after hardware testing where "no smoke" means the basics are working.

---

## Comments — when to use them

A comment should add context the code itself doesn't make obvious. If someone can read the code and immediately understand what and why, the comment is noise.

```javascript
// USEFUL — explains WHY, not just WHAT
// SQL injection attempt - verifies the form handles malicious input safely
{ username: "' OR '1'='1", password: "", error: "Your username is invalid!" }

// USELESS — the code already says this
// click the login button
await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Login' }).click();
```

Good test names often make comments inside tests unnecessary.

---

## YAGNI

**You Aren't Gonna Need It** — don't over-engineer. Only add structure (like a POM or fixture) when the problem actually exists, not in anticipation of it. A test suite that's simple and works is better than one that's complex and hard to maintain.

---

## The test pyramid

The ideal balance of tests in a real QA team:

- **Many API tests** — fast, reliable, test data and business logic directly
- **Fewer UI tests** — slower, test that the interface works for real users

API tests run in milliseconds. UI tests run in seconds. At scale, that difference matters a lot.

---

## Terminal commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx playwright test` | Runs all tests |
| `npx playwright test login.spec.js` | Runs one specific file |
| `npx playwright test --headed` | Runs with the browser visible (not for API tests) |
| `npx playwright test --grep "test name"` | Runs only tests whose name matches |
| `npx playwright show-report` | Opens the HTML test report |
| `npx playwright codegen https://...` | Opens the recorder |

> Press `Ctrl+C` to quit the report server. The terminal won't accept new commands until you do.

---

## Git commands

Git saves snapshots of your code over time. GitHub stores your code online.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `git add .` | Stages all changed files ready to commit |
| `git commit -m "message"` | Saves a snapshot with a description |
| `git push` | Sends your commits up to GitHub |
| `git status` | Shows what files have changed |
| `git log` | Shows your commit history |

---

## CI (Continuous Integration)

Every time you push code to GitHub, it automatically runs all your tests in the cloud. A green tick means all tests passed. A red cross means something broke.

CI runs on every push regardless of what changed — even a README update triggers the full test suite.

---

## Errors you will see

### `TimeoutError`
Playwright waited 30 seconds for an element and couldn't find it.
**Usually means:** wrong role, wrong locator, element not on the page. Always inspect the HTML before writing locators.

### `expect(...).toBeVisible() failed`
The assertion check failed — the element wasn't visible.
**Usually means:** the action before it didn't work, or the wrong locator.

### `strict mode violation`
Your locator matched more than one element.
**Fix:** Add `{ name: '...' }` or use `.first()` or `.last()`.

### `Unterminated string constant`
A string is missing its closing quote `'` or backtick `` ` ``.

### `'import' and 'export' may only appear at the top level`
You've put an `import` or `export` inside a function or block. They must sit at the very top of the file.

---

## Common mistakes to watch out for

- Missing `()` at the end of `.click()`, `.toBeVisible()`, `.toBeChecked()` etc
- Missing closing quote `'` or backtick at the end of a string
- Using `'button'` as a role when the element is actually a `'link'` — always inspect the HTML first
- Using the same `const` name twice in one test
- Putting `export` or `import` inside a block instead of at the top of the file
- Using `--headed` on API tests — there's no browser to open
- Pushing `test.only` to GitHub — it causes all other tests to be skipped in CI
